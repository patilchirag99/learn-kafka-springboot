Learning Springboot kafka
In this project "deliveryclient" creates some random location values using Math.random() and publishes to the Kafka server runnning on the local machine.
"enduser" acts as the client who recieves this data from the kafka server. 
We can imagine this as a realtime location tracking where delivery partner send location values and the enduser recieves it.
